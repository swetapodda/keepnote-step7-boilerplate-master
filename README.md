## Seed code - Boilerplate for step 7 - Keep Note Assignment

### Assignment Step Description

In this case study Keep Note Step 7, we are going to implement async  messaging communication  using AMQP protocol  and RabbitMQ message broker.  
List of step to be done :
1.  Installation of RabbitMQ :
https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html
Please ensure running od RabbitMq on default port 5672 ;

2. Zipkin Distributed Server 
You can get Zipkin Distributed server by either of following :
a)https://zipkin.io/pages/quickstart.html

b)Download Zipkin Server as jar from   https://search.maven.org/remote_content?g=io.zipkin.java&a=zipkin-server&v=LATEST&c=exec

c) Find attached Zipkin Jar with this project . 

Zipkin server will execute on port 9411 so please keep this port free. 

Add one environment variable RABBIT_URI=amqp://localhost

To run Zipkin server from jar :  java - jar zikin-server.jar

3. Register all your services with Zipkin 
appication.properties

spring.zipkin.base-url=http://localhost:9411/

Add POM dependency in every services for amqp and zipkin 

Now infrastructure is ready , please ensure following implementation 
--------------------------------------------------
1. Using spring cloud Sleuth generate unique ID for every request .
2. Use Logger to log generated ID along the life of request among  different services 
3. Use ZipKin to view and trace all logges of different services in one Zipkin Console. 


----------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations you are done with this Step.

=======================================


You should set following propertes for Microservices


application.propertes for all Services except Eureka server 
========================
  spring.application.name= {{name of the application }} 
  server.port=  {{port number suggested above}}

### Steps to be followed:

    Step 1: Clone the boilerplate in a specific folder on your local machine and import the same in your eclipse STS
    Step 2: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for AuthenticationService and run the test cases.
    Step 3: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for UserService and run the test cases.
    Step 4: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for NoteService  and run the test cases.
    Step 5: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for CategoryService and run the test cases.
    Step 6: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for ReminderService and run the test cases.
    Step 7: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for netflix-eureka-naming-server
    Step 8: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for netflix-zuul-api-gateway-server
    
    

### Project structure

The folders and files you see in this repositories, is how it is expected to be in projects, which are submitted for automated evaluation by Hobbes

    Project
	   |
	   ├── AuthenticationService                   // This is the microservice for User Authentication
	   ├── NoteService                             // This is the microservice of Note   
	   ├── CategoryService                         // This is the microservice of Category

       ├── .project			            // This is automatically generated by eclipse, if this file is removed your eclipse will not recognize this as your eclipse project. 
       └── pom.xml 			            // This is the parent POM, which holds all the microservice projects.
    
> PS: All lint rule files are by default copied during the evaluation process, however if need to be customizing, you should copy from this repo and modify in your project repo


#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in the folder **assignment-solution-step7** of your local machine
     
    `git clone https://gitlab-ibm.stackroute.in/stack_java_keep_v2/KeepNote-Step7-Boilerplate.git assignment-solution-step7`

2. Navigate to assignment-solution-step7 folder

    `cd assignment-solution-step7`

3. Remove its remote or original reference

     `git remote rm origin`

4. Create a new repo in gitlab named `assignment-solution-step7` as private repo

5. Add your new repository reference as remote

     `git remote add origin https://gitlab-ibm.stackroute.in/{{yourusername}}/assignment-solution-step7`

     **Note: {{yourusername}} should be replaced by your username from gitlab**

5. Check the status of your repo 
     
     `git status`            

6. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

     `git add .`
 
7. Commit and Push the project to git

     `git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

     `git push -u origin master`

8. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed

### Important instructions for Participants
> - We expect you to write the assignment on your own by following through the guidelines, learning plan, and the practice exercises
> - The code must not be plagirized, the mentors will randomly pick the submissions and may ask you to explain the solution
> - The code must be properly indented, code structure maintained as per the boilerplate and properly commented
> - Follow through the problem statement shared with you

### MENTORS TO BEGIN REVIEW YOUR WORK ONLY AFTER ->
> - You add the respective Mentor as a Reporter/Master into your Assignment Repository
> - You have checked your Assignment on the Automated Evaluation Tool - Hobbes (Check for necessary steps in your Boilerplate - README.md file. ) and got the required score - Check with your mentor about the Score you must achieve before it is accepted for Manual Submission.
> - Intimate your Mentor on Slack and/or Send an Email to learner.support@stackroute.in - with your Git URL - Once you done working and is ready for final submission.
